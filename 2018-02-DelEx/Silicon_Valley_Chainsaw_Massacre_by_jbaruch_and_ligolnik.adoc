== Logs
Вместо доступа к логам - аггрегаторы (`logstash`, `loggly`, `splunk`). все они умеют маскировать sensitive data.

* search &amp; aggregation tools
* data masking
* alerting capabilities

<<<
*NOC*:: network operations center.

== Well-defined severity definitions
* Who sets the severity:
** support
** customer
* Expected SLA
* Update frequency expectations

TIP: Use tickets instead of voice messaging

== Effective reachability
* Virtual extensions (8-911 reaches person on duty), etc
* Escalation chat has two approaches:
** one room for all escalation
** one room per support ticket
 * Virtual phone bridge. http://company.zoom.com/emergency could be used, for example.

== Escalation path
* Who do you wake and when?
* How do you reach them?
* All the way to the CEO

== Manager on-call
* External communications
* Activities coordination
* Resource management

== Production access
* Ability to deploy hotfixes
* Documented steps for:
** debug
** log level changes

== Effective shift handover
* Pick a standard day of week/time

== Other barriers
* Training
* Certification (with financial benefits)
* Knowledge transfer / runbook


== Getting started with on-call
* this will take time
* start with senior folks
* find intitial partner in peer teams
* * start small
